This is a guide on how to customize Mapeo Mobile and Desktop for versions **4.0.0-beta and above**, and the instructions may be different than earlier versions.

## Creating a Mapeo Settings file

If you want to have a custom configuration for the tags and icons, see the [guide to creating a Mapeo Settings file](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-settings-builder/blob/master/README.md#table-of-contents).

A `.mapeosettings` file is a **tar** file, similar to a zip file. You can see the contents of the file by changing the file extention to `.tar` and using any application that can extract tar files.

*If you would like to help improve this process, contributions are actively welcomed!*

## Mapeo mÃ³vil

Mapeo Mobile does not currently support a raw `.mapeosettings` file, and instead will need a manual import process using an extracted directory.

1. Rename `myfile.mapeosettings` to `myfile.tar`
2. Use a tar extraction program to untar the file. 
3. Place this folder in the appropriate directory on the Android device using `adb push`. [More information on adb](http://adbshell.com/commands/adb-push)

[The instructions for which directory to place your settings folder can be found here on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/blob/master/README.md#usage).

## Escritorio Mapeo

#### Automated import

Mapeo Desktop supports importing `.mapeosettings` files in the user interface.

After you've created your settings file, you can import it by navigating to **File->Import Configuration...**.

#### Manual import

You can also extract the `.mapeosettings` file as a tar file into the following directory:

    USERDATA/Mapeo/presets/default
    

* USERDATA is the per-user application data directory, which by default points to:
    
    * `%APPDATA%` on Windows
    * `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or ~/.config on Linux
    * `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS

This folder (`default`) expects these files directly in under this default folder (i.e. no sub-folder with a different name):

    presets.json
    icons.svg
    etc...
